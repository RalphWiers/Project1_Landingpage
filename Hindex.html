    <h2>Some Hippo info</h2>
    Hippos differ from all other large land mammals being of semiaquatic habits, and spending their days in lakes and rivers. 
    They can be found in both savannah and forest areas.Proper habitat requires enough water to submerge in and grass nearby. 
    Larger densities of the animals inhabit quiet waters with mostly firm, smooth sloping beaches. Male hippos may be found in very small numbers 
    in rapid waters in rocky gorges. Hippos mostly live in freshwater habitats, however populations in West Africa mostly inhabit 
    estuarine waters and may even be found at sea</p>

    <h2>Hippo's & Habitat</h2>
    <p> Types of hippo's are:
        <u1>
            <li><strong>northern hippopotamus or Nile hippopotamus</strong> H. a. amphibius – (the nominate subspecies) which stretched from Egypt, where they are now extinct, south up the Nile River to Tanzania and Mozambique.</li>
            <li><strong>East African hippopotamus</strong> H. a. kiboko – in Kenya in the African Great Lakes region, and in Somalia in the Horn of Africa. Broader nasals and more hollowed interorbital region</li>
            <li><strong>Cape hippopotamus</strong> or <strong>South African hippopotamus</strong> H. a. capensis – from Zambia to South Africa, most flattened skull of the subspecies</li>
            <li><strong>African hippopotamus</strong> or <strong>Tchad hippopotamus</strong> H. a. tschadensis – throughout Western Africa to, as the name suggests, Chad, slightly shorter and wider face, with prominent orbits</li> 
            <li><strong>Angola hippopotamus</strong> H. a. constrictus – in Angola, the southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia, named for its deeper preorbital constriction</li>
